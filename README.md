## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I offer consultancy in statistics, biostatistics, machine learning and *methods comparison*. **If you have a problem you can't solve and if you can get to find me you might hire me.**

I have resurrected some old methods for Deming's robust regression (M- and MM- or Huber and Tukey if you prefer). I proposed a single test based on the Mahalanobis distance (MD) to replace the typical slope and intercept confidence interval tests performed separately and without FWER. Finally, I developed a Bayesian method for Deming regression that can be run in robust mode and also has models suitable for heteroschedastic data. I maintain two packages on **CRAN** whose sources can be found below:

- [*mcrPioda*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mcrPioda): this is a clone of the mcr package with additional M- and MM-Deming regressions and the function for the MD test.
- [*rstanbdp*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanbdp): is the package for dealing with Deming regressions in Bayesian mode. Robust methods and methods for heteroschedastic data are available.

[Here is an interesting read from 2021 on comparing methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04628)

[Here my new advances for method comparison](https://piodag.github.io/)

I have a PhD in chemistry (like Wilcoxon and Tukey) and have previously worked on:
- homogeneous enantioselective catalysis
- reaction kinetics
- 3D structure determination of proteins via NMR
